Hey!

My name is Rony Langbord-Golan, I'm 26 years old and recently I graduated my B.Sc in CS.

Just finished to build the game according the instructions you provided me with. I've decided to build the game with
Java script using the Canvas element. 

My greatest advantage is that I'm really hungry for challenges and to learn more all the time and therefore I chose to build the game using JS which I've never used before (learned only basics and concepts).

In the past two days I taught myself and that will be the best presentation that reflects my motivation and fast-learning skills.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Rony L
